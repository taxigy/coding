# Limit the number of revisions for code review

Subj.

This is a crude tool to increase the quality of code review
process, its speed and accuracy. Just say, "Whatever happens, if
the pull-request is turned down two times, no review is necessary
afterwards, whatever the changes".

How can you be sure that a programmer doesn't ruin all the things
on the third take after two failed reviews (aka change requests)?
You actually can't. You may even think somebody will exploit it.
Well, if not, there still will be somebody who does that: the
reviewer.

A reviewer shall never asses a PR in hurry or bad mood. Any bias
caused by an unrelated problem can crack the team's productivity.

Setting this simple rule, you make two things possible: better
communication and greater respect of people's time.

Better communication means that, if the pull-request is _really_
problematic, for a reviewer it will be safer to just connect with
the author and solve problems on air. It's pair coding (known as
extreme programming, XP), a powerful combat tactic against bad
and possibly buggy code.

Greater respect means lesser number of cases when a reviewer
clicks that "Request changes" button because it's fast and
convenient for them (and quite disturbing for the author). It
suddenly becomes all about being responsible for the team, not
just acting within the boundaries of one's duties.

That's team hacking, so use wisely.
