# Codebase management

Codebase management is when a couple smart guys who write code
decide on best practices about how the code in their new project
will be organized. From very high-order stuff like, what will be
a common pattern of introducing new features to QA, UAT and
end-users, to small things like should all the sources be placed
in `./src` folder or it's better with `./client` and `./server`.

It's a big thing that receives little attention, because nobody
likes it. Usually nobody gets paid for it, either. You spend
time, it's totally zero movement towards the goal, and you're
like, screw it, we'll figure out later. What comes later usually
is technical debt.

See [building blocks](building-blocks.md) to get an idea of what
a typical codebase consists of.
