# Research vs Coding

A good programmer is a very skilled one. A good programmer can
code anything. Serve socket connections, generate PDFs, work with
a dozen bank APIs, do it synchronously or not, with UI or not, on
multiple servers or not. A good programmer usually starts by
looking for a bunch of libs for a fav programming language _to
not do things that somebody else has done_.

A good product engineer looks for solutions on the market. Is
there a SaaS for that? Do they offer free tier? Do they offer a
cheap version maybe, the cheapest possible? These days, _a lot_
of operations have been transformed into neat services that one
can pay a penny for, and use them up to some threshold, hardly
reachable for a product that is in development or completely new
to the market.

Computer run-time is cheap. People are expensive. Also, mass
market is cheap. So a good product engineer walks into the market
and exits it with a basket full of subscriptions that will allow
his team to use a bunch of remote APIs to cut images, extract
intents and entities, store and serve files, perform quick
stateless computations and such. With average monthly running
cost of $20 per service, and given there's at most 10 such
services, it's $200 per month. Probably an hour or two worth of a
good programmer's work time.
