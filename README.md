# Coding

This is a (very badly organized) collection of tips on programming, building algorithms, introducing and then fighting technical debt, negotiating with peer programmers, and generally writing code (possibly) the right way. **Source**: [https://github.com/taxigy/coding](https://github.com/taxigy/coding).

You are welcome to fork the repo and collect your own thoughts. Don't hesitate to contribute back if you find a very important gotcha nobody has taught you before.

Programming discipline is universal and hardly can become outdated in years, and while teaching is the best form of learning, I believe this repo should happen to be useful to a bunch of coders out there.
